Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GPTiny.git
cd GPTiny
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install torch
```

3. **Download training data**:
```bash
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt
```

4. **Train the model**:
```bash
python bigram.py
```

Configuration

Modify hyperparameters in `bigram.py`:

```python
batch_size = 64        # Reduce if GPU memory is limited
block_size = 256       # Context window size
max_iters = 5000      # Training iterations
learning_rate = 3e-4  # Adam optimizer learning rate
n_embd = 384          # Embedding dimension
dropout = 0.2         # Dropout probability
```

Usage Examples

Training a New Model
```python
# Modify hyperparameters as needed
python bigram.py
```

Generate Text
```python
# After training, the model automatically generates 500 tokens
context = torch.zeros((1,1), dtype=torch.long, device=device)
generated_text = decode(model.generate(context, max_new_tokens=500)[0].tolist())
print(generated_text)
```

Custom Training Data
Replace `input.txt` with your own text corpus. The model will automatically adapt to your vocabulary.

Technical Deep Dive

Self-Attention Mechanism
The model implements scaled dot-product attention:
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
```

Multi-Head Attention
Parallel attention heads capture different aspects of relationships:
- **4 attention heads** with 96 dimensions each (384/4)
- Concatenated outputs passed through linear projection

Causal Masking
Uses lower triangular masking to ensure autoregressive generation (tokens can only attend to previous positions).


**Expected Performance**:
- Initial loss: ~4.3 (random predictions)
- Final loss: ~1.4-1.6 (good Shakespeare-style generation)
- **Lower validation loss indicates better generalization**
